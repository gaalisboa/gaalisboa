- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gabriel. You can call me Biel or whatever. I'm 19 and a junior back-end developer with C#
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in working at any company/team that thinks that I can do something for them (or not ðŸ˜…) to help me grow even more my programming skills and get some professional experience
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently sharping my C# ASP.NET MVC/API development (.NET 6) and JavaScript knowledge.
